## Concept

**HiLo Escape** is a horror game where you have to guess if you have a higher or lower hand in poker than your opponent. The protagonist has the
the choice to rewind the time or to continue with his choices, but there is always a chance he can die at any moment in any timeline.

## Behind the scenes
The game was made between 5th April and 6th April under 21 hours by 3 students in the same team at *HackItAll*. Here is the list of the teammates:
